# Projects
All my noteworthy projects. Enjoy! 

### 1. For Client, Providence Treatment Center Website - [Repo](https://github.com/melmar12/Vendit_v2) - [Live](http://www.providencetreatmentcenter.com/)
  * PTC is a private day school for special needs students. The goal of this new website was to make the school reachable to new visitors and keep parents of currents students up to date. This site started off as a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript webpage that I converted into a Rails app in order to add the capability to create and manage data using Rails Active Record. The client wanted the ability to create 'announcements' (to alert of a school closure for example). The web app also hosts downloadable and printable documents stored on the cloud using AWS s3 buckets. Secure admin login functionality exists for managing these alerts and documents.
  * #### Tools Used:
    - HTML5, SASS, Javascript
    - Ruby on Rails
    - Heroku

### 2. Archived Personal Website - [Repo](https://github.com/melmar12/personal-site2) - [Live](http://www.melissamartinez.me/)
  * This was a version of my personal website made to act as a visual resume and to display my projects. I started this site off as a static webpage using Rails so that I can add dynamic content like an email submission form and implement a personal blog to the site in the future. I decided on a modular design so that I can easily add or remove sections as needed. I also utilized SASS variables to be able to easily change the theme. Although I'm not using this current version anymore, this is a great example of my Frontend skills. I've taken a minimalist approach with my new personsonal website [here].
